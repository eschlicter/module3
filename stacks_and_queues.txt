>What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?

A stack uses last in first out (LIFO) and a queue uses first in first out (FIFO)

>What are the similarities between stacks and queues?

Stacks and queues both allow devs to rank tasks & create an order of oppressions.

>Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?

I would use a stack for UNDO to remove the most recent item from the stack (LIFO) and a queue for REDO to utilize first in first out (FIFO).

###Programming Questions
You may program the following question in any language of your choice. Before you begin coding, write out a plan as to how you will solve the question.

>Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".

Steps in function: 1) Create an empty string. 2) One by one push all characters of string to stack. 3) One by one pop all characters from stack and put them back to string.
```
function reverseString(string){
var emptyString = [];
for (let i = 0; i <= string.length; i++){
emptyString.push(string.charAt(string.length - i));
}
return emptyString.join('');
}
reverseString("Bloc!");
```

>Implement the delete functionality of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure.

>To delete an item, take all of the elements in the queue one at a time and put them at the end of the queue, except for the last one which should be deleted and returned.
```
CLASS Stack
 FUNCTION pop(queue)
  SET the element at the stack position index to temp
  DECREMENT the stack position index by 1
  RETURN temp
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS
```
>Fill in the methods for the following Queue class so that it will work as expected (FIFO).
```
CLASS QUEUE
 FUNCTION enqueue(element)
   APPEND element to end of list
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION dequeue
   SET temp to the first element
   REMOVE first element of list from list
   RETURN temp
 END FUNCTION
END CLASS
```
