###Short Answer
> What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?  

Searching for a name in a phone book by going sequentially.  

> What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?  

Finding a book in a library by finding the correct aisle with the corresponding Dewey Decimal Classification by splitting the aisles into sections of greater than or less than specified Dewey number.

>Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.  

Linear, since binary search does not work with unsorted collections.  


>Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.  

Binary, because it is more efficient.

###Programming Assignment:
>You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

```
 function searchDictionary(collection, value){
   var low = collection[0];
   var high = collection[collection.length-1];
   while (low <= high){
     var mid = (low + high)/2;
     if(collection[mid] > value){
       high = mid - 1;
     }else if(collection[mid] < value){
       low = mid + 1
     }else{
       return mid;
     }
    }
   return "Word not found";
   };
```

>You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

```
 var findFish = function(collection, target){
    var result = null, value;
   for(var i = 0; i < collection.length; i++){
     value = collection[i];
     if(value === target){
       return "You found the fish!"
     }
   }
   return "No such fish";
 };
```
