###Short Answer
>Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: Programmers use pseudocode to help express what code should do in plain, non-technical language.

>If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: Pseudocode will not run on a computer.


###Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

>Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

A:
```
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than or equal to second number
	PRINT first number
ELSE
	PRINT second number
```

>Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

A:
```
let number = 1;

while (number <= 10) {
  console.log(number);
  number++;
}
```
```
FUNCTION
SET number to 1
WHILE number is less than or equal to 100
	PRINT NUMBER
END FUNCTION
```

>Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

A:
```
SET variable to ARRAY
INPUT a name
IF name is found in ARRAY
	PRINT name and location in array
ELSE
	PRINT 'Not Found'
END
```
>Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
```
var phonebook = ['John Smith', 'Jane Smith', 'Chad Smith']

function nameFinder(phonebook, name){
  var location=''
  for (var i = 0; i < phoneBook.length; i++) {
      if (name == phoneBook[i]) {
        location = (name + ' at ' + i)
      }
  }
  if (location === '') {
    return 'Not found'
  } else {
    return location
  }
}
```
